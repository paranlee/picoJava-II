Interrupts are maintained by a list of <code>interrupt_t</code> objects. Each
object contains whether the interrupt has been disabled, the time at
which the next interrupt due to this object will be scheduled, whether
it is a repeating interrupt and the frequency of repetition.
<P>
Instruction counts are the units of time used. Instruction counts 
are implemented as 32b integers.
<P>
An interrupt scheduled at "time" x is taken, or at least evaluated,
before executing the x+1'th instruction. Therefore an interrupt list
command after the x'th instruction will show the interrupt at time
x as enabled, and not yet taken.
<P>
Two global variables - next_sched_intr_icount (the time at which the
earliest interrupt will be scheduled) and next_intr_id keep track of
when and which interrupt is the next to be scheduled. 

This limits the overhead spent on 
checking-for-scheduled-interrupt. When the
<I>icount</I> becomes equal to <I>next_sched_intr_icount</I>,
<code>intr_dispatch</code>() is called, dispatching 
an interrupt and setting the <code>pj_irl</code> or <code>pj_nmi</code> 
pins to the appropriate value.
<P>
After dispatching the interrupt, <code>intr_dispatch</code>()
checks all interrupts scheduled at that <I>icount</I>. 
<code>intr_dispatch</code> disables all interrupts, 
unless the next interrupt is a repeating interrupt, in
which case, it is scheduled.
<P>
The global variable <I>icount</I> tracks of the number of instructions
executed.
<P>
Disabling interrupts cannot be enabled.
Interrupts are disabled by a user command or by a scheduled
non-repeating interrupt.
