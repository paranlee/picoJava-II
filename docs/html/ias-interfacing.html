<A NAME="1"> <H2>Overview</H2></A>
There are several ways in which the picoJava-II simulation backend
is currently used. The backend currently runs only on big-endian, 32b
words SPARC machines.
The backend is available as:
<UL>
<LI>Integrated with the default frontend based on Tcl.  This is the
standard IAS. </LI>
<LI>As an independent set of libraries which a given front-end can
be linked to. These libraries are linked with the gdb frontend
to provide <code>pico-gdb</code>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
These libraries work in  multiple configurations.
You may or may not wish to use the loader built into the backend.
<code>pico-gdb</code> does not use this loader. It supplies its own ELF loader and 
user interface. 
<P>
The following is a standard list of functions provided by 
the simulation library. The default memory configuration is 16MB. 
You can define other memory sizes by setting the 
environment variable PICOJAVA_MEMORY_SIZE.
<P>

Most of these functions have been derived from the gdb interface. Some
of them do nothing, but are required for compatibility.

   During execution of this function, the simulator captures the SIGINT signal 
   and restores the original handler when returning. The status of SIGINT is 
   only checked between instructions so the the simulator is in a consistent 
   state when it returns due to a SIGINT.
