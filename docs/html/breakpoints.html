<P>
Breakpoints in IAS are modeled (somewhat) on breakpoints in <font face="courier"><code>gdb</code></font>.
Each breakpoint can be either a code breakpoint or a data read or write
breakpoint. A breakpoint can be in either a disabled state or enabled
state and has an ignore count. When a match is generated on an enabled
breakpoint, IAS triggers a breakpoint is triggered if its ignore count 
is zero. If the ignore count is non-zero, IAS decrements the count 
and execution continues.

<P>
Once a breakpoint has been set, you can only disable it, but cannot 
delete it.  This is a known and accepted limitation, and will not be fixed. 
Breakpoints are set on absolute addresses; IAS does not provide symbolic 
breakpoints.

<P>
Currently, the maximum number of breakpoints you can set in a session is 1,000.

<B>Behavior</B>
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
All breakpoints are set at a byte boundary. Code breakpoints are triggered
only if an instruction about to be executed starts at the set address; 
A code breakpoint that is set in the middle of an instruction causes unexpected
behavior. Data breakpoints are triggered by all accesses that "cover" the 
breakpoint address: for example, a 32-bit write to the address 0x1000 triggers a 
breakpoint set at address 0x1002. 

<P>
For code breakpoints, IAS returns control to you just before it executes 
the instruction that triggers the breakpoint. Data breakpoints are like 
watchpoints in that control is returned to you at the end of the instruction that 
touches the breakpoint address.  

<P>
IAS ignores code breakpoints during execution of the first instruction 
of a fresh run, steps, or the <font face="courier"><code>continue</code></font> command that you issue. This behavior 
is to facilitate continuation of program execution after a code breakpoint has 
been triggered without having to explicitly disable the breakpoint to 
avoid triggering it immediately.

<P>
Following are the commands for breakpoints using the Tcl interface. 
When a breakpoint is set, it is enabled by default and has an ignore 
count of zero.
