<P>
<B>Q. What environment variables can control the execution of IAS?</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The following are the environment variables that IAS looks for:
<P>
<B><code>DSVHOME</code></b>: Not used by the backend, but used by IAS 
or MFS front-ends to load trap handlers from <code>$DSVHOME/class/<var>predefined_class_names</var>.class</code> and to locate the TCL front-end shell from <code>$DSVHOME/etc/sim/sim.tcl</code>.
<P>
<B><code>PICOJAVA_MEMORY_SIZE</code></B>: Sets the size of the "common memory."
Has to be set to the size of the memory required in Mbytes. For example, either of:
<P>
<code>setenv PICOJAVA_MEMORY_SIZE 24</code><br> 
<code>setenv PICOJAVA_MEMORY_SIZE 0x18</code> 
<P>
sets the size of the memory to 24MB. If the variable is not set, or is set
incorrectly, reverts to the default value (typically 16 Mbytes). 
<P>
This does not affect the "scratch" area.
The size of the main memory should not be set such that it overruns the scratch
area. 
<P>
This environment variable is applicable to both RTL and ias.
<P>
<P>
<B><code>PICOJAVA_SYSCALL_LIB</code></B>
contains the name of the dynamic library to be used for 
the syscall functions. For example: 
<P>
<code>setenv PICOJAVA_SYSCALL_LIB libsyscall.so.1</code>
<P>
This environment variable is applicable to both RTL and ias.
<P>

<B><code>IAS_MAX_INSTRUCTIONS</code></B>: An environment variable that IAS
looks up during reset. If IAS reaches an internal maximum instruction 
limit of 5,000,000 it terminates a program (as a safeguard to halt runaway 
programs) You can change this 
maximum by setting the <code>IAS_MAX_INSTRUCTIONS</code> environment variable to a numeric value, up to 64 bits. For example:

<font face="arial, helvetica">
<P>
<B><code>PJSIM_EXIT_ON_WARNING</code></B>: If set to any value, causes a memory 
access warning to halt the simulator. The default is to print the warning and 
continue execution.

<P>
<B><code>PJSIM_PORT_HANDLER</code></B>: If set, contains the path to a dynamic 
library that simulates the serial port, which can be attached to IAS 
for interfacing a debugger, for example:<BR>
<code>PJSIM_PORT_HANDLER libconsole.so.1</code>.

<P>
<B><code>PJSIM_TRACE_LIB</code></B>: If set, contains the path to a dynamic 
library which provides functions that are called on every execution of an 
instruction and on every memory access, for example:<BR>
<code>PJSIM_TRACE_LIB sample_libtrace.so.1</code>.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Q. Can I change the values of the machine registers?</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Yes, all machine registers are bound to TCL variables. You can set these variables using the TCL syntax and the machine registers are then set accordingly. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B>Q. What happens if I switch off the stack cache with the <code>scache off</code> 
command in IAS?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The stack model specified by the Java virtual machine operates on a stack
in memory: the definition of the stack cache, the data cache, and so forth
are implementation issues and outside the scope of the Java virtual machine. 
Hence, the stack cache and the data cache are totally transparent to a 
program with pure instructions. 
<P>
When you switch off the stack cache in IAS, it operates as if 
there was no stack cache and all stack operations were being performed
directly on memory. (An analogous condition can never exist on the real
hardware since hardware can perform its operations only on the stack cache, 
which is a register file.  Therefore, you cannot switch off the stack cache
on the hardware--this is a convenience feature in IAS.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Q. How accurately does IAS model the picoJava hardware? In particular, 
how does IAS model dribbling, which is supposed to be asynchronous?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Fairly accurately, since picoJava has a simple microarchitecture without
too many asynchronous entities. Modelling stack cache dribbling does pose
a problem, however, because dribbling occurs in the background, depending on when 
the bus is available and other factors.  Also, stack cache modelling requires 
detailed, clock-cycle accurate information. Since this is beyond the scope of 
IAS, the simulator simplifies things by assuming an infinitely fast 
memory system, which satisfies all dribble requests before any other requests 
can go through. For example, if an instruction causes the number of valid 
stack cache entries to go to 7 and the PSR.LWM is set to 16, IAS 
<em>instantaneously</em> dribbles in all the entries that are required to 
make the number of valid s-cache entries equal to 16. 
<P>
Basically, at the end of each instruction (more precisely, at every update
to <code>OPTOP</code>), the dribbling watermark conditions are satisfied before continuing. The 
rules on saving and discarding data for overflows and underflows are specified in 
the caches chapter of the picoJava-II PRM.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Q. Can the contents of the caches in IAS be different from what the
contents would be on real hardware?</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Yes, they can. Due to the differences between how IAS does dribbling
and how it would be done on real hardware, the patterns of memory access 
in /IAS and in real hardware can be different, leading to divergence
in the cache contents. Of course, the state of memory visible from normal 
programs is consistent between the two.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Q. How accurately does IAS model the FPU inside picojava, esp 
FP operations involving Nan's whose outputs are not precisely spec'ed by IEEE ?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Completely accurately, down to the last bit pattern. the FPU behaviour
for results not completely specified by IEEE is defined in the picoJava-II PRM; 
ias implements the same. Be sure to compile ias in IEEE-compliant mode on
your platform.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Q. Does IAS understand folding?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
No, because IAS does not need to understand folding. As far as cosimulation with 
RTL is concerned, it understands that two or more instructions are folded in RTL
and simply issues two <code>step</code> commands to IAS before comparing the
state.
<P>
IAS does look at the <code>PSR.FLE</code> (folding enabled) bit to decide 
if hardware level breakpoints are enabled. (Hardware level breakpoints are 
different from simulator breakpoints.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Q. How can I extend the simulator?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Any way you want, but the preferred model is to set 
an environment variable to enable the extensible feature, place the extension 
code into a dynamic library, and have the IAS core look for this library. 
You must code into the IAS core the details of when and how to invoke
functions in the library that you provide. 
<P>
Currently, external interfaces exist for the following: 
<UL>
<LI>
Calling user-supplied functions after every instruction or every 
memory reference.
<LI>
A system call library, triggered by a memory write to a magic
location, which causes the simulator to transfer control to
a function in a dynamically linked library.
</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Q. Can I do limited program I/O?</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The preferred way to implement I/O is through the system call mechanism 
described above. However, if you need very limited functionality, 
a simple form of program I/O is available through a "console" at address 
0x2f0000c0. A <code>ncstore_byte</code> to this address is interpreted specially 
by the simulator; the ASCII character represented by the byte is written to the 
screen.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Q. Can the simulator load ELF files generated by the picoJava C compiler?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Yes. Use the <code>loadElf</code> command, which loads your ELF file
into the machine's memory. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Q. What is the picoJava memory map in the current environment? Are there 
any special locations I can access to trigger special actions? </B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Yes, some memory addresses have special semantics. For details of the memory 
map, see the <i>picoJava-II Verification Guide</i>, or see file <code>$DSVHOME/ldr/src/cm.h</code>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Q. Can IAS collect instruction counts and other statistics?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
IAS collects some information as it runs; however, it does not model 
clock-cycle-accurate information. See the dumpStats command for details.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Q.  Since the picoJava core can be configured for different cache sizes, and for 
the absence of an FPU, how can I configure these parameters in the 
simulator?</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Use the <code>configure</code> command.
