<A name="whatis"></A>
<P>
<B>Q.   What is IAS?</B>

<P>
IAS is a simulator which models
the picoJava family of processors. Specifically, the current version of
the simulator models picoJava-II accurately. (You may occasionally see
IAS being referred to as PJSIM - both are synonyms for the same simulator)

<P>
IAS models the following:

<UL>
<LI>The picoJava instruction set, including <code>*_quick</code> and other instructions 
that the picoJava hardware implements, as well as the on-core 
caches, such as the D-Cache, I-Cache, and S-Cache.
<p>
<LI>The processor registers, the dribbler, 
the FPU, exceptions, emulations, and other kinds of traps, interrupts to 
the processor, and so on. 
</UL>

<P>
Basically, IAS models all functionality in the
picoJava-II Programmer's Reference Manual and is a 
comprehensive and accurate functional model of the 
picoJava hardware.  It does not model precise timing (clock cycle) 
information since it goes by instruction boundaries only.  Its primary 
purpose is to serve as a golden model for verifying the hardware 
implementation.  However, it is also useful 
for those who need access to the picoJava functionality via a simulator 
before they have access to actual picoJava-based hardware.

<A name="machines"></A>
<P>
<B>Q.    What platforms does IAS run on?</B>

<P>
IAS runs on SPARC platforms running Solaris 2.5.1 and up. 
For information on running IAS on other
platforms, see the document <a href="./ias-porting.html">Porting IAS</A>.

<A name="interface"></A>
<P>
<B>Q.    What is the user interface provided by IAS?</B>

<P>
The simulator is based on a Tcl frontend, which automatically provides
a Tcl environment for the user interface and the ability to use the Tcl
language to extend the command set. It should be easy to bolt on a
Tk-based GUI frontend to it, if someone is interested. 
 
<P>
You can use the picoJava simulation backend in other ways without the 
Tcl interface, such as <code>gdb</code> for picoJava which links to the
simulation backend, and provide its own frontend.  
<P>

<A name="run"></A>
<P>
<B>Q.     How do I run IAS?</B>
<P>
Type ias at the command prompt. In the picoJava-II environment, the 
binary for ias usually resides in the directory $DSVHOME/bin

<A name="inside"></A>
<P>
<B>Q.     How do I get help while inside the simulator?</B>
<P>
Type <code>usage</code> for online help, which prints a one-line
summary for each of the commands that are available.

<A name="env"></A>
<P>
<B>Q.    How should I set up my environment to run IAS?</B>
<P>
Set the environment variable <code>DSVHOME</code> to the root of
a decaf system verification (<code>DSV</code>) tree. 

<P>The <code>DSVHOME</code> environment variable:

<UL>
<LI>Locates Tcl scripts from <code>$DVSHOME/etc/tcl</code>.
<LI>Locates the frontend Tcl-based interpreter from the file 
<code>$DSVHOME/etc/sim/sim.tcl</code>. 
<LI>Locates trap handlers, which the program looks for in <code>$DSVHOME/class/<var>trap_name</var>.class</code>. However, if a file called 

<code><em>trap_name</em>.class</code> already exists in the current
directory, then that file name is used instead for the various
trap-related class files. See the next question.
</UL>

<A name="state"></A>
<P>
<B>Q.   What is the state of the machine at startup?</B>
<P>
At startup, IAS first looks at <code>$DSVHOME/class</code> and in the current directory (see the <A HREF="ias-primer.html#env">previous</A> question)
and loads in the trap handlers it can find from these two locations. 
The names of the trap handlers are preassigned and fixed. 
<P>
IAS loads the following three types of trap handlers:
<UL> 
<LI>Reset code, which IAS looks for in <code>reset.class</code>
and loads at address 0
<LI>Handlers for exceptions, such as divisions by zero, 
misaligned or out-of-range addresses, different kinds of interrupts, and so
on. The default handler terminates the program on encountering any 
such exceptions.
<LI>Emulation traps: Some of the higher-level Java instructions that are 
complex to implement in hardware cause a trap in order that the 
instruction may be emulated by software. Examples are: 
<code>invokevirtual</code>, <code>getstatic</code>, <code>ldc</code>, 
and so on. The emulation trap handlers implement this functionality 
and must be loaded in order to properly run Java programs which have
these instructions in them.
<P>
See the <em>picoJava-II Programmer's Reference Manual</em> for
details about which of the Java virtual machine instructions take 
emulation traps. 
</UL>
<P>
<em>Note</em> - By default, IAS outputs a warning if it cannot 
find any of these trap handlers, except for the exception handlers.
<P>
All exceptions and traps have an associated trap type (see Table 12-1
in the <em>picoJava-II Programmer's Reference Manual</em>). 
The trap vector table is initialized to point to the
respective trap handlers. In the current picoJava environment, the trap
vector is hardcoded to address 0x10000; the trapbase register is initialized 
to 0x10000.
<P>
Next, the machine initializes the registers to the power-on values
(see Table 8-1 in the specification). As a debug feature, all uninitialized
memory and the stack cache are initialized to the pattern 0xdeadbeef.
The machine is now at pc 0, ready to execute instructions.
<P>
Finally, IAS reads the file <code>.iasrc</code> in the current 
directory and executes the commands in that file.  The simulator is 
then ready to accept user commands. 

<A name="load"></A>
<P>
<B>Q. How do I load a program (<code>.class</code> file) into the 
simulator?</B>
<P>
Use the <code>loadClass</code> command, which installs the class file 
into the machine's memory and sets up the tables for class structures 
and so forth. If any of the superclasses of this class have not been
loaded, IAS loads them as well.  The simulator searches for
these classes in the same locations as those for the trap handlers: first 
in the current directory, and if it cannot find the classes there, 
then under <code>$DSVHOME/class</code>.  
<P>
If a class is already loaded, 
<code>loadClass</code> prints an error; 
it is illegal for the same class to be loaded twice in the same system.

<A name="control"></A>
<P>
<B>Q. How does control reach this program?</B>
<P>
The reset code (from reset.class) is loaded at address 0.
The default is to pick up reset.class from the $DSVHOME/class directory.
(You can also customize the 
initializations and override them with a <code>reset.class</code> in 
the current directory, however.  See the 
<A HREF="ias-primer.html#lastpara">last paragraph</A>.)
<P>
The default version of the reset code does the following: 
<UL>
<LI>Performs system initializations, such as turning on dribbling, 
initializing the registers, and so on.
<LI>Executes all <code>.clinit</code> methods in classes which
contain these methods. 
<LI>Searches all the classes for a static method called <code>main</code> and jumps to it. 
</UL>
<P>
After <code>main</code> has finished executing, IAS returns 
an integer value, which the reset code then picks up and emits as the 
final status of the run with the following message:
<blockquote>
<code>IAS: TEST PASSED</code><br>
(meaning that the exit code is 0)</blockquote>
<P>or:
<blockquote><code>IAS: TEST FAILED - Return Code xx</code><br>
(meaning that the exit code is nonzero)</blockquote>
<P>
<b>Note</b> - The signature for the <code>main</code> method is:<br> 
<code>public static int main ()</code><br>
not:<br> 
<code>public static void main (String[] argv)</code><br> 
as in regular Java virtual machines.
<P>
The default reset code launches <code>main</code> in superuser mode 
(<code>PSR.SU</code> = 1).  This methodology should not affect high-level 
Java code, but may have some bearing on programs that contain low-level 
machine details that are written in picoJava assembly.

<A name="lastpara"></A>
<P>
If you want more control over how the reset code sets things up, 
create your own <code>reset.class</code> in the current directory. You 
can either disassemble the default <code>reset.class</code>, patch it and assemble it back, or write your own.

<A name="dynamics"></A>
<P>
<B>Q. Are classes loaded dynamically ? </B>
<P>
No, we do not support dynamic loading.  Unless you load all the 
classes that your program needs during execution,
you may see a cryptic <code>TEST FAILED: CLASS NOT LOADED</code> error later on. 
<P>
Be sure to find out what classes you may possibly need and load them 
all with the <code>loadClass</code> command. A common gotcha is not 
loading the classes for exception objects, which may be created along
the way.

<A name="runtime"></A>
<P>
<B>Q. What runtime environment is available to the program?</B>
<P>
Very little, since porting of the bulk of the runtime environment to 
picoJava hasn't happened yet. However, the basic functionality that is
required to implement the Java virtual machine instruction set (such as 
memory allocation) is handled internally by a small kernel embedded into 
the trap handlers. Beyond that, all API functionality has to be created
for the simulator. There is a system call mechanism the simulator supports
which should be used as the basis for implementing native code functionality.

<A name="debug"></A>
<P>
<B>Q. What debugging features are available?</B>
<P>
Debugging features include: <code>run2</code>, 
<code>dumpStack</code>, <code>dumpReg</code>, <code>dis*</code>, and <code>itrace</code>. 

<UL>
<LI><code>itrace</code> level 1 prints out trap and exception entries, as well as exit messages. 
<LI><code>itrace</code> level 2 prints out all method calls and returns, <code>jsr</code>s, and <code>ret</code>s in addition to the level 1 output.
<LI><code>itrace</code> level 3 prints out the disassembly of each 
instruction as it is being executed in addition to the level 2 output. 
This is probably the most useful level.
<LI><code>itrace</code> level 4 prints out register contents after 
every instruction in addition to the level 3 output.
<LI><code>itrace</code> level 8 prints out <em>every</em> memory reference as it occurs in addition to the level 4 output.  This output is <em>very</em> verbose.
</UL>

<A name="mt"></A>
<P>
<B>Q. Can I run multithreaded programs on the simulator?</B>
<P>
Not unless you provide the software layer for locking, thread creation, 
scheduling, and other features, which is not yet available. This is part of 
runtime software functionality, not hardware functionality; ias models only the
hardware.

<A name="hello"></A>
<P>
<B>Q. What are the steps for running through a <code>Hello, world</code> program?</B>
<P>
Well, <code>Hello, world</code> is more difficult since you need to have system
call support in your runtime environment.  However, here's a simple example of a Java 
program that adds two numbers together.

<p>
<code>
add.java:<br>
class add { <br>
public static int main () { <br>
int a = 3, b = 4, c = 7;<br>
if (a + b == c)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;return (0); // indicates pass<br>
else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;return (2); // indicates fail<br>
}}<br>
</code>

<P>
Follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI>Create <code>add.class</code> by typing at the prompt: 
<code>javac add.java</code>.
<P>
<LI>Type: <code>ias</code> at the prompt.
<P>
this emits a bunch of messages about loading trap handlers, etc, then gives
you a prompt and is ready for program execution.
<P>
<LI>Type <code>loadClass add</code> at the prompt.
<P>
<LI>Type <code>run</code>.
<P>
IAS then runs and ouputs a message like this at the end:<br>
<code>IAS: Test PASSED, 189 instructions, 0 interrupts taken, 0 total traps</code>
<P>
<LI>Type <code>exit</code>.
</OL>

<A name="tools"></A>
<P>
<B>Q. What other tools are available that are specific to the 
picoJava environment?</B>
<P>
A picoJava assembler, called <code>jasm</code>, can assemble picoJava and Java virtual machine instructions. The 
corresponding disassembler is called <code>jdis</code>.
<P>
Another tool, called <code>classDump</code>, provides information about 
class files.

<A name="jasm"></A>
<P>
<B>Q. How do I write a program in picoJava assembly language?</B>
<P>
Presumably, you want to write code that is specific to the picoJava
environment and which uses the picoJava instruction set. To do so, you 
can use the <code>jasm</code> assembler (see the <A href=ias-primer.html#tools> previous</A> question) to write your own assembly. 
<P>
You write a user program in exactly the same way as mentioned 
<A href=ias-primer.html#hello>above</A> for Java programs: The entry point 
should be a static method called <code>main</code>.
<P>
Here is a minimalist, complete version of an assembly-level <code>main</code> program:
<P>
<code>
nop.jasm:<br>
public class nop {<br>
public static Method main:"()I"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;stack 1 locals 0<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sipush  0; // simply return a 0 exit code<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ireturn;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
</code>

<P>
Type <code>jasm nop.jasm</code> to create <code>nop.class</code>, then
run <code>ias</code> and <code>loadClass nop</code>, and execute <code>run</code> and other commands just as you do with a high-level 
Java program.

<P>
Be sure to use the versions of <code>jasm</code> and <code>jdis</code> from the picoJava environment.
