Stack Cache Operations</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The stack cache is a 64 entry register file which caches the 
top few entries of the operand stack.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These conditions must be true at ALL times about the S-Cache, both in the
RTL, and in the IAS model:
<UL>
<LI>All memory accesses that are generated as offsets from OPTOP, 
VARS or FRAME are stack accesses.  They must first determine if 
the needed location exists in the S-Cache. 
All other memory accesses must go directly through the D-Cache, and
not the S-Cache. 
<P>
The test condition to determine if an address is an S-Cache hit
is if the address is in the interval (OPTOP-4words, SC_BOTTOM). 
<P>
In IAS, all type 'O', 'F', or 'V' accesses must go
through the S-Cache. Also, all type 'G' accesses are debug accesses,
which always should go through the S-Cache.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Memory accesses generated as offsets from OPTOP must ALWAYS hit the
S-Cache, except for accesses from microcode, as noted below.  IAS and the
RTL assume that the S-Cache at all times contains the locations
corresponding to the 4 top words in the stack, and the 2 empty words
above Top of Stack.
<P>
Accesses to these locations are assumed to directly hit in 
the S-Cache and do not need a hit or miss detection. 
OPTOP offsets are always between 4 and -1, inclusive.  
<P>
The dribbling mechanism enforces the above restriction in the 
IAS throught the routine vUpdateSCache which must be called 
*every* time OPTOP is updated. The *only* way to update 
OPTOP is through vUpdateGR in global_regs.c.
<B>Never update OPTOP anywhere else.</B>
The dribbling mechanism enforces the restriction in the
the RTL by the Stack Manager Unit holding the pipe whenever 
this condition is false, until it becomes true. It
will eventually become true due to the dribbling operation. 

<P>
In the IAS, the dribble required to satisfy this condition happens
immediately following the instruction which invalidated this condition. 
However, in the RTL, this dribble is processed in the background, and can
lead to possible mismatches in the cache state between the IAS and the
RTL. This is unavoidable. However, the program visible memory state
between the RTL and the IAS must always be consistent.
<P>
An access which is not guaranteed to hit in the S-Cache, such as an
offset from VARS, performs a single lookup in parallel and does not
need an extra cycle in the RTL.
<P>
<LI>The correct satisfaction of the above condition can only happen
when the dribbler is enabled (PSR.DRE = 1). If the dribbler 
is disabled, the Stack Manager Unit does not hold the pipe, 
and the requirement of 4-62 entries in the S-Cache is not met, nor is
the S-Cache underflow or overflow operation 
handled correctly. Operations therefore could potentially
operate on wrong data. <P>

<B>The programmer is completely responsible anytime
the dribbler is switched off.</B> This includes during the reset code, until
PSR.DRE is switched on. The S-Cache operation is not transparent to
the program during this time. Therefore the dribbler is not just a performance
feature which can be switched off. It is required to be on for correct
program behaviour, unless of course the program understands S-Cache behaviour
and knows what it is doing.</LI>
<P>
<LI>An address of an S-Cache hit is always stored at the entry
in the S-Cache corresponding to the 6 LSBs of the address.</LI>
<P>
<LI>As documented in the spec, the fill_mark should never be set to 0. 
Doing so causes incorrect program behaviour. If it is set to 0 with the 
dribbler enabled, IAS will detect this condition and immediately terminate. 
<P>
<LI>The word pointed to by SC_BOTTOM is considered present in the S-Cache.
</UL>

<h2>Usage</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The commands <code>scache</code> <I>on</I> or <I>off</I> and 
<code>cache</code> <I>on</I> or <I>off</I> control the enabling of
the S-Cache and D-Cache and I-Cache respectively inside IAS. 
You can enable or disable them independently of each other.
The default is <code>scache</code> <I>on</I> and 
<code>dcache</code> <I>off</I>.
<P>
You can completely disable the S-Cache operation in IAS by setting
<code>scache</code> <I>off</I>. This makes the instructions 
operate directly on the program stack in memory through the D-Cache,
if it is enabled.
