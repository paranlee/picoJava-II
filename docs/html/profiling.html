<h2>Overview</h2></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
IAS has a rudimentary profiler which you can use for profiling single or 
multi-threaded applications. The profiling is at the function (or trap) 
level, and can count self as well as self and children timings. IAS profiles 
functions in terms of instruction counts, since an instruction is the 
smallest quantum of execution it understands. The IAS profiler can do 
"self+children" kind of analyses at a function or block level, and has some 
controls to support multi-threading, etc.
<P>
Several operations are available to control profiling, all of which
are available programmatically as well as from the command line.
The profiler supports creation of multiple profiles, up to the
current limit of 32, with the intended use being one 
profile associated with each running thread, but more creative uses 
are always possible. Any one (or none) of these profiles may be 
active at a given time. 
<P>
All the instructions executed during when a profile is active are 
charged to the profile.
Each profile maintains track of the call stack during execution, and in
turn charges instructions to the function whose code is currently being
executed as well as to all functions below it in the call stack.
<P>
Profiling can be disabled at any time. In this state, the profiler 
continues to track call stack activity, but effectively does not 
count the instructions passing by. This is useful when you want specific 
parts of execution to be (not) timed.
<P>
The profiler tracks all call stack changes triggered by the 
instructions:<CODE>inv_*_quick</CODE>, <CODE>inv_i/f</CODE>, <CODE>call</CODE>, 
<CODE>return0/1/2</CODE>, <CODE>athrow</CODE>, and
<CODE>priv_ret_from_trap</CODE>. 
The profiler assumes that the calls and returns are always 
in LIFO order for any given profile. 
<P>
Profiling can also be "frozen". This is meant for cases where software
running on the chip knows that following the call stack using the
usual means will confuse the profiler. For example,  when a kernel
uses <CODE>priv_ret_from_trap</CODE> multiple times while switching
contexts.
<P>
Another case where this is useful is when invoking a method
using reflection, in which case dispatch may possibly be done without 
an explicit <CODE>invoke_*</CODE> instruction. In such cases,
when software knows that profiler cannot follow the call stack
accurately, it should freeze the profile and  then unfreeze it
in the same call stack state as when it was frozen. In this case,just disabling the profile is not sufficient.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> A frozen profile may still be enabled. It may continue 
to count instructions. It just stops following call stack changes, 
and charges all instructions to the topmost block in the stack. 
A warning is printed if the profiler determines the call stack 
depth to go below 0, or above the maximum of 4096. 
In such cases the software must explicitly mark the entry into a new block.
<P>
As in most profilers, a program can control the timing of blocks within 
a function. A program is not limited to timing only whole functions. By 
inserting profiler commands around the block begin and end
However, the program is then responsible for ensuring that all such
block enters and exits happen in a LIFO manner. the name of all such
blocks are simply listed as "USER_DEFINED_BLOCK" in the summary - we can 
later look into whether more flexibility is needed in naming user-defined 
blocks.
<P>
A profile should normally be "closed" before it's data is printed out.
Closing a profile pops off the remaining stack frames, and completes
attributing instruction counts to the various frames. You can print
out a profile's data without closing it.  However, the data will not 
reflect counts for functions still on the stack.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> Profile data is currently not part of the checkpointed state in 
IAS.
<P>
The runtime overhead on IAS performance due to profiling depends on 
the amount of activity up and down the call-chain.  The overhead
typically is less than 5% and should not be more than 10%.
There is little to no overhead if profiling is
not used even in a version containing profiling support.
<P>
You can compile IAS without any profiling code.  Use:
<CODE>undef</CODE> <CODE>PROFILING</CODE> in 
<CODE>tools/dsv/sim/src/sim_config.h</CODE>
There is some memory overhead per profile created (a few tens of KB per 
profile + a constant times the number of unique function blocks entered).
<P>
The <CODE>dumpStats</CODE> command now also dumps out the state of all profiles.
printing out the profile also gives other interesting information
such as the maximum depth of the call stack.
<P>
Names are assigned only for traps and Java functions. Since C code function
names are not accessible, IAS prints the generic string
"C-call"  for C functions, along with the function address.

<P>
The same effect of controlling the profile can be achieved by an
ncstore_word to the PROFILE_CMD_ADDR (0xffc0) with the following
value:
<UL>
<code>
#define PROFILE_CREATE_CMD 1
#define PROFILE_RESET_CMD 2
#define PROFILE_FREEZE_CMD 3
#define PROFILE_UNFREEZE_CMD 4
#define PROFILE_ENABLE_CMD 5
#define PROFILE_DISABLE_CMD 6
#define PROFILE_SWITCH_CMD 7
#define PROFILE_PRINT_CMD 8
#define PROFILE_CLOSE_CMD 9

#define PROFILE_MARK_BLOCK_ENTER 20
#define PROFILE_MARK_BLOCK_EXIT  21
</code>
</UL> 
Prior to this, the address <CODE>PROFILE_DATA_ADDR (0xffc4)</CODE> must have been written
to with an ncstore_word, indicating the profile id that the command
operates on. a profile id of (-1) signifies the "current" profile, 
whatever it's id. 
<P>  
One can imagine a simple Profiler class which offers methods to
perform each of these commands; application programs can then
transparently make calls to create, enable, close, print profiles.<
