This directory contains the picoJava(TM)-II design database.  It
contains the following:

picoJava-II 		picoJava-II Design tree

   README		This file 

   docs			Microarchitecture Guide (MAG), 
			Programmer's Reference Manual (PRM), 
			Verification Guide, and html files to get started with 
			the design database

   sim			Simulation environment, tests directory and the files 
			to build new and existing tests

   tools		Simulation tools directory


The following directory is included in Distribution 3 (the entire database):

   design		RTL design files, emulation trap code and exception 
			code directory
   
Please refer to the README file in each directory for more information
on the contents of that directory.

For beginners:

Goto the 'design' directory. This directory will give you a first look of the 
overall design in rtl form. The top level cpu structure is in 'rtl'. The 
individual 'rtl' blocks are in the different sub-blocks such as 'dcu/rtl', 
'icu/rtl' etc. The trap and exception handling routines 
are in 'exception' and 'traps' directories. Once you have an idea of what the 
blocks look like, set the appropriate environment variables (as shown below). 
Follow the 'README' in the 'tools' directory to build executables in order to 
compile the 'rtl' files, run simulations, etc. Make sure you have the 
'tools/bin' directory in your search path. You may now wish to run a 
sample test case to see what the core does. Instead of running 'steam' you may 
want to goto 'sim/test/sample_tests' to run a simple test case. Follow the 
'README' in that section to run a sample test case. Once you feel comfortable 
with the environment, model and tools, you may want to run more detailed 
simulations such as run 'steam', etc.
