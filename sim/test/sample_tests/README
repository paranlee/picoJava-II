This directory contains sample test cases to be run on the 
picoJava(TM)-II design and a basic environment for running them. 

The 5 sample test cases that have been included are:
  
dcu_2_7.code      
Tests load cache hits.

icu_3_1_1.code 
Tests Icache control during ICache hits.
  
push_pop_1.code
256 pushes, 256 pops. This test verifies the normal conditions of the stack 
manager. In filing up the stack cache with 256 entries, the Dribble Manager 
fills and spills entries according to the settings of the high and low 
watermarks. 

FADD_000.code
Tests the FADD operation.    

arithm_int.code
Verifies the results of iadd, isub, idiv, imul, irem and ineg. This test 
picks operands arbitrarily and performs one calculation for each intruction.



Please refer to the top level README.html for information on 
simulating these tests.
