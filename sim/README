Directory	Description

config		Contains the Makefile and the steam.plusargs file for the 
		different options used during steam execution

env		Contains the different monitors and test bench for the core. 
		It also has "vfiles" - list of files to be included in the 
		compilation of the core. 
		
******************************************************************************
SPECIAL NOTE WHEN THE SIMULATIONS ARE RUN WITHOUT THE FPU:

When the "fpu" module is NOT being used in the simulations the users have to
make sure that the following guidelines are adhered to - 

The steps to configure the core without the floating-point unit (FPU) are:

         1.Edit $PICOJAVAHOME/$PROJECT/design/rtl/defines.h 
            to comment out the line:
                  `define FPU_MODULE fpu 
         2.Uncomment the following lines:
                  `define FPU_MODULE fpu_dummy 
                  `define NO_FPU 
 
Also, if the fpu is NOT used in the design, the user will have to have 
their own floating point emulation trap routines to emulate the behavior of 
the fpu block.

include		Contains the script and necessary files to make testcases

test		Contains pico_vts and sample_tests directory which contain 
		the entire verification test suite for picoJava-II, the 
		suite.control file and 5 sample test cases. 		
 
syscall_example	Contains an example to try out the system call 
		functionality in the picoJava-II environment
