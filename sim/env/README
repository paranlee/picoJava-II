Support for generating DAI's Signalscan database of the simulation
is included in this testbench environment.  By default, these
system calls are not enabled.  To include this feature, you must define
SIGNALSCAN in sys.h.

You need to produce a Cadence Verilog or Synopsys VCS executable which
includes the Signalscan PLIs.  See the README file in the tools directory
for more information.
