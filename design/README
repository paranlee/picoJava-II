The following directory contains all the verilog and synthesis 
files for the different units in the picoJava(TM)-II design. 
These files can be found in the "rtl" and "syn" directories within 
different units. 


*******************************************************************************
Synthesis Scripts

The design direcory also contains sample synthesis scripts. These can be found 
in the "syn" directory within each block. 
The user will have to create a "db" directory or change the scripts to 
write the results in appropriate places. The library setup information can 
be found in the "lib_setup" directory under "design". The user will have to 
add appropriate paths for their vendor specific libraries, set_dont_use 
statements to exclude slow cells, and correct wireload models for their design. 
Users can also find path constraints between different blocks, these 
need to be modified based on the library information. 
False paths in different blocks are also provided (within the 
synthesis scripts) which need to be included for correct timing information. 

The synthesis scripts are structured to compile in the following manner:

The top level "rtl" directory contains the verilog code for the topmost 
block called the "cpu". It also has behavioral descriptions of all the 
muxes, flops, custom cells and spare gates used and the defines used in the design.
